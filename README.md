# Week1--InClassExercise2_Hypercube

Here you are asked to consider the following situation:

Consider n-dimensional unit ‘cubes’
n=3 -> a cube. Coordinates= (x1,x2,x3) [or (x,y,z)].
n=2 -> a square. Coordinates= (x1,x2) [or (x,y)].
n=1 -> line. Coordinates= (x1) [or (x)].

n=4 -> 4-dimensional hypercube. Coordinates= (x1,x2,x3,x4).
n=5 -> 5-dimensional hypercube. Coordinates= (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5).
n=N -> N-dimensional hypercube. Coordinates= (x1,x2,x3,x4,…,xN).

Let’s suppose that all are unit cubes, so 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1,  for all i.

Question 1: If we sample a point uniformly at random from inside a hypercube, 
what is the probability that the point is within a distance of 0.1 of the surface?


Question 2: How can you use your answeer to question 1 to find the what proportion of 
the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube that is within a distance of 0.1 of the surface?

Pseudocode for this problem can be found in the HypercubePseudocode.Rmd file in this repository.
